// ! What is ES6?

//**  ES6, short for ECMAScript 6, is the sixth edition of the ECMAScript standard, which is the specification that JavaScript is based on. It introduced significant enhancements to the language, bringing new features and syntax improvements to JavaScript. ES6 was finalized in 2015 and brought about several important additions such as arrow functions, template literals, let and const for variable declarations, classes, modules, and more. These new features aimed to make JavaScript code more expressive, readable, and maintainable. Since its release, ES6 has become widely adopted and forms the basis for modern JavaScript development.

// !! What is ECMAScript

//** ECMAScript (ES) is a standardized scripting language specification standardized by Ecma International in ECMA-262 and ISO/IEC 16262. JavaScript, JScript, and ActionScript are examples of languages that conform to the ECMAScript specification. ECMAScript provides the rules, details, and guidelines that a scripting language must follow to be considered ECMAScript-compliant.
